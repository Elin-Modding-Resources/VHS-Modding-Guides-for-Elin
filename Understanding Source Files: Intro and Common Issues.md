# Overview

Want to know how to manipulate those weird Excel files everyone keeps putting in their mods? What they do? What each field represents? Don't worry, I'll put together what I've learned here so that you can figure it out, too.

By the way, I like to use Google Sheets to edit these, since it's free and can export to xlsx, which is what Elin uses.

## Common Issues
P : Help! My file's not loading properly! / The data is coming back as zero!
S : This can happen if your fields aren't formatted correctly. Excel will convert numbers you input into the 'number' format, but Elin can only read data if it's in a 'plain text' format. You can change this under the format tab of your program.
