### Adding Custom Actions to Elin
Heya! Ever wanted to do something cool in Elin- a move of your own machination? Yeah? Well, sadly, it's a tad hard, since there's no one telling you how to do it right now. That's where I step in!

Actions in-game refer to available states your character can perform, such as attacking, casting spells, meditating, watering plants, chopping down trees, or sleeping. Players can use these moves directly, or can be forced to by other scripts.

Actions are made up of a few things: A data-storing Element, a function-running Action Class, and the relevant graphical assets.

To set up an action, you need to create an Element to represent the action. Elements store stuff like the name of the action and how much it costs to use. 

``` var dir = Path.GetDirectoryName(Info.Location);
SharedPokemonSprites.loadPath = dir + "/Texture/";
var excel = dir + "/PokeRaces.xlsx";
var sources = Core.Instance.sources; ```
